<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<br>
<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. <br><br>

We collect very general demographics from site users: city, country, language, and amount of time on website. We do not collect personally identifiable information like name from visitors of our site unless you specifically provide it through the contact form, or through the newsletter forms. We will have your email information only if you enter it into these forms by your own choice. However, this information is solely used for the purpose of communicating with the information submitted and is never sold or otherwise intentionally released. We use the information that you provide in order to respond, if we choose, to your attempts to make contact and to send newsletters, which you have the option of unsubscribing from at any time. We reserve the right not to respond to unsolicited messages from the contact form or otherwise. <br><br>


We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.
We only provide articles and information. We never ask for credit card numbers.
We do not use Malware Scanning. <br><br>

We use an SSL certificate. We only provide articles and information. We never ask for personal or private information like credit card numbers. We obtain information about you only if you choose to provide it using one of the site’s contact form. In that case, you are willingly and openly providing this information. We will not sell or otherwise make public your email address or other identifying information that you provide. <br><br>

We use cookies for tracking purposes. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information. We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website for which we are compensated. The site owner receives no compensation of any kind for third-party links on the site; they are provided only for informational purposes. <br><br>

Google’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. <br><br>

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify the users by providing a message on this page within 7 business days. <br><br>

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors. <br><br>

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations. We would only have your email address if you specifically provided it to us through the forms on this website, and the email address will only be used in order to get in touch with you, if we so choose, or alternatively, to send you a newsletter or notification, when you sign up for that list. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at mail (at) falondarville.com and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence. You also have the option of opting out at the bottom of the email in the footer section. <br><br>
