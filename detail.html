    <h3>Transcript</h3>

<p>Welcome to The Darville Podcast. I’m Falon Darville. I write articles on culture, creativity, and the workplace. In this podcast series, I hope to challenge you and get you thinking. I’ll talk about lesser spoken of implications that we are facing when we use social media, problems that arise from lack of authenticity in the workplace, and more. I’m going to be coming to you as a partner in thought. It’s not about agreement or disagreement. It’s about collaborating on coming up with alternatives and assessing them against our current model. Together, we’re going to think beyond the surface level, and ask important questions. My aim is that I’ll get you thinking more intentionally about our modern culture. So this is a practice in thought and in sitting with different perspectives. <br><br>

Today I’ll be continuing the conversation on Personal Branding. I started this discourse on the falondarville.com blog, so if you want to read some of my other thoughts on this topic, please reference the article. To recap, in this article, I talk about the heavy focus recently on personal branding. By personal branding, I’m talking about more than crafting a resume, solid LinkedIn profile, and portfolio. Personal branding is a step beyond presenting your qualifications. It’s the act of formulating a persona that will be used during networking and making yourself visible to potential employers, future clients, and colleagues. <br><br>

While some people have managed to create brands around their names and done so well, the concept of personal branding can have some adverse effects. When we look at the core of personal branding, it’s about showmanship and understanding our audiences. In this process, it is not difficult to harness an inflated sense of self and move forward with presenting our experiences, expertise, and titles in heightened light. With a movement of people using personal branding techniques, one of the problems that can arise in hiring is candidates appearing overly qualified for a role. <br><br>

Through personal branding, individuals are encouraged to claim as much expertise and responsibility as they can wring out. Many jokes have been made out of this persona inflation. The janitor calls himself a Facilities Sanitation Expert, the social media marketer calls herself the Marketing and Visual Communications Guru, the front-end web developer calls himself the Code Goblin and Cryptocurrency Wizard. This inflation demeans the real value of the individual behind the title. These formulations keep us in the era of inauthenticity, closeness, and prevent us from developing human workplaces. <br><br>

On the other side, personal branding can also encourage diminishing aspects of ourselves to appease particular employers. I am currently attending a coding bootcamp, and through this program, the students have access to career services. During one of the sessions with our career advisor, he told us that if we have owned a business, we should change our title from business owner or CEO to something less threatening. He said that this would ensure that employers felt comfortable interviewing us, because they would not think that we knew more than them. <br><br>

There is a strong push for people to represent themselves as robust machines of never ending enthusiasm for their jobs and unwavering loyalty towards their employers. Some people even feel driven to misrepresent themselves and their skill set when they apply for jobs. When we are asked to construct ourselves into brands, we lose some of the human-ness of what we do. We are in fact humans who do things. In the shadow of a personal brand, we are a thing that does things. Through personal branding, we are relieving our more vulnerable selves from the critiques and ego-hitting feedback that we receive. We begin  to dissociate from and continuously mutate the branding that we have created. <br><br>

This is moving farther away from the progress that we have made to humanize the workplace. Branding turns people into commodities, people do this to themselves. I recently saw on LinkedIn a series of heated posts regarding whether or not it is rude to send a connection request without sending a note alongside it. The comments told the story of many people with internalized beliefs about the organism of LinkedIn and how it should work. In one of these posts, one woman stated that sending a connection request to an individual on LinkedIn that you do not know is the equivalent of going up to a stranger on the street. <br><br>

They associated their importance and status on the social media site, and related it with a standard of courtesy that they arbitrarily assigned to others. This is to say, they got offended because they had an inflated interest in protecting their integrity online, and garnering the respect of people behind computer screens. Their internalized protocols got in the way of differentiating the landscape of online interaction versus in-person interaction. <br><br>

One of the primary arguments for having a presence on social media like LinkedIn is that you will get to reach out and start dialogues with people you had not previously known. With this in mind, it is easy to see why protocols like those suggested by that woman are riddled with implications. <br><br>

Social media tends to have dissociating properties. Through the comments regarding connecting with people you do not know in person, it appears that people seem to feel entitled to others understanding their online boundaries without explicitly telling others what those boundaries are. When presenting ourselves online then, we appear to want to inflate ourselves and provide an impenetrably impressive version of ourselves. We are told that if we brand ourselves in the optimal way, we are resourceful and fully taking advantage of networking. So then in the context of implied standards of courtesies, we want to appear so important that people will trouble themselves and guess in which way we want to be interacted with. <br><br>

This sense of self-importance can be damaging. Being in the time of social media, we already live with muddled identities. Our curated selves online are only marginal representations of who we are in person. But personal branding takes this to a whole new level. Becoming a brand involves stricter alterations and trimming of the core being. In personal branding, people attempt to sum up the most succinct, regulated, and neutrally-provocative version of what they think will appeal to others. It’s focused on singular aspects of individuals, without so much allowing for the intellectual and evolutionary practice of change and alteration.<br><br> 

We’re holding appearances through personal brands. The personal branding narrative is entangled in the idea that we need to make ourselves outwardly appealing to an audience. We’re wireframing, designing, and building out a look for the way we want others to see us, and this look doesn’t always account for the human side of work. The human side of work will evolve from the hierarchical model into more collaborative spaces as innovation comes to really matter. <br><br>

We talk about innovation to the extreme but it’s not in a  tangible capacity for the majority of businesses. The outliers make the news and make it look like we’re the new Atlantis. <br><br>

Rather than innovation, we are all becoming used salesmen. We pawn ourselves off as the ultimate prize that a company to obtain. And if we choose to work for ourselves, many of us are selling impotence. In this, I mean that a lot of personal brands are selling impotent information under the guise that their data is proprietary, easier, faster, and more effective. When audiences are disillusioned by personal branding, they are more open to buying into the brand. They’re invested in buying the repackaged information. They spend money on information that is already free, cheap, or otherwise easily gotten. <br><br>

Personal branding lacks the intimacy of genuine person to person interactions. People buy into the brands that people create, and perhaps even think that they are buying into the real person. But that isn’t the case. A brand is a formula. It is a representation. It has a monetary or social purpose. On a personal level, brands may help people to cope in the social media age. Personal branding is a form of hiding then. <br><br>

Anthropologically, humans have formed tribes and social networks in the past for their safety. We have also perhaps felt safe in group settings like companies, which hold lesser risk for individualized liability. In the digital age, we are each called to represent ourselves on a profile attached to our name, a picture of ourselves, and other identifying information. If we begin to brand ourselves, we in some form create a barrier between ourselves and our audience. Others do not have to know what we are really like, and we can mask our vulnerabilities through inflating those areas in which we feel rather confident. <br><br>

That’s it for our discourse on personal branding today. As a prompt for further thought, what alternatives to personal branding do you see arising? Do you think more authentic representations of self will help us achieve a more human workplace? For more ideas and further discussion, you can find the article entitled Personal Branding on falondarville.com. Thanks for tuning in.
